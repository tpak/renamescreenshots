# Changelog

All notable changes to Screenshot Renamer will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.1] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- Removed stale `Info.plist.backup` from Resources that caused SPM build warning
- Cleaned stale build artifacts from previous repo name (`renamescreenshots`)

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-26

### Changed
- **Repository renamed** from `renamescreenshots` to `ScreenshotRenamer` to match the app name
- Updated all GitHub and GitHub Pages URLs to new repo path (user guide, appcast feed, badges)
- **Note:** Existing v1.5.2 installations will not auto-discover this update; download manually from [Releases](https://github.com/tpak/ScreenshotRenamer/releases/latest)

### Removed
- Cleaned up old Python LaunchAgent (`com.screenshot-renamer.menubar`) and artifacts from pre-Swift version

## [1.5.2] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- **Screenshot settings preserved across updates** — app continuously persists known-good settings to its own UserDefaults and restores them on launch if macOS reset `com.apple.screencapture` defaults (e.g., after a Sparkle update). Replaces the v1.5.1 approach that depended on the Sparkle delegate firing before termination. (closes #21)
- Added debug logging throughout settings detection, snapshot save/restore, and Sparkle update flow for diagnosing future issues

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- **Sparkle update no longer resets screenshot settings** — app now snapshots all `com.apple.screencapture` settings (location, prefix, format, options, delay) before installing an update and restores them on next launch

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **Prefix field in Settings** — edit the screenshot filename prefix directly from the Settings dialog (closes #17)
- **User Guide menu item** — opens the online user guide from the menu bar (closes #18)
- **User Guide on GitHub Pages** — standalone HTML user guide at `https://tpak.github.io/ScreenshotRenamer/` with getting started, settings reference, screenshot shortcuts, and troubleshooting (closes #19)
- **Docs deployment workflow** — automatically deploys `docs/` to GitHub Pages when changed on main

### Fixed
- **Release workflow no longer destroys gh-pages** — switched from orphan-branch approach to merge-based deploy, preserving existing files (e.g., user guide) when updating the appcast

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Auto-update toggle** in Settings — "Automatically check for updates" checkbox (defaults to on)
- Auto-update status shown in menu bar options summary

### Fixed
- App crash on launch due to missing `@loader_path/../Frameworks` rpath for embedded Sparkle.framework
- Tests now properly restore all user preferences after `testResetToDefaultsResetsLocationAndPrefix` (previously only restored location/prefix, leaving other settings at defaults)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Auto-Update via Sparkle** — "Check for Updates..." menu item checks for new versions and installs them in-place
- Automatic background update checks on app launch
- EdDSA-signed updates for secure delivery via GitHub Releases
- Appcast deployment to GitHub Pages for update discovery
- Sparkle 2.x framework embedded in app bundle

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Capture Delay** setting in Settings dialog — set a timer (None, 5 Seconds, 10 Seconds) before screenshot capture, matching macOS Screenshot utility's Timer option
- Capture delay shown in menu bar options summary when enabled (e.g., "5s Delay")
- `writeIntDefaults()` utility for integer macOS defaults values

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Watcher race condition** — FSEvents could trigger multiple concurrent directory scans, causing "file doesn't exist" errors when two scans tried to rename the same file (#13)
- Replaced per-file `Task {}` with debounced `DispatchWorkItem` that coalesces rapid events into a single rename operation

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
- **Reset to Defaults** now properly resets screenshot location to Desktop and prefix to "Screenshot"

### Changed
- Default debug log renamed from `debug.log` to `screenshotrenamer-debug.log` to distinguish from other logs in `~/Library/Logs/`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Unified Settings Dialog** — all preferences now in one window:
  - Editable save location field (type path directly or use folder picker)
  - All screenshot options with checkboxes
  - Launch at login toggle
  - Debug logging section with Set Location, Open, and Clear buttons
  - Reset to Defaults button
- **App Icon** — camera icon now displays in Finder and Applications folder
- **About Dialog Icon** — camera icon shown in About dialog
- **Menu Quick-Reference** — current settings displayed as info items in menu:
  - Location, Prefix, Format
  - Options summary (Thumb, Cursor, Shadow, Date, Auto-start)
  - Debug status
- **Single Instance Prevention** — app detects and prevents duplicate instances
- **Semantic Versioning Scripts**:
  - `./Scripts/bump-version.sh [major|minor|patch]` for manual version control
  - `./Scripts/build-app.sh --bump` flag for auto-increment on build
- **Icon Generation Script** — `Scripts/generate-icon.swift` creates AppIcon.icns from SF Symbol

### Changed
- Settings menu reorganized: separate items replaced with unified "Settings..." dialog
- Debug submenu moved from menu bar into Settings dialog
- Launch at Login moved from menu bar into Settings dialog
- Window title changed from "Screenshot Settings" to "Settings"
- Settings dialog now 550x480px to accommodate all options

### Fixed
- Version not displaying correctly in About dialog (build script now copies Info.plist before restoring original)
- Tests now restore user's screenshot location after running (previously reset to Desktop)
